# tinyurl

URL shortening is used to create a unique shorter alternative for long URLs. These save a lot of space while storing, displaying on a website, or messaging. Once clicked on a short URL, it converts ID to URL and redirects to the original URLâ€™s website. We convert each alphabet in URL to int and add it to the final URL ID. We have 62 possible chars i.e. A-Z, a-z, 0-9, if we can make a URL of length n, then we can have a total of 62^n URLs.

Example: If a company wants to serve more than 1 billion URLs, we use this technique to reduce the size of the URL and keep it as short as possible.

A URL shortener service creates a short url/aliases/tiny url against a long url.Moreover, when user click on the tiny url, he gets redirected to original url.

Tiny url are exceedingly handy to share through sms/tweets (where there is limit to number of characters that can be messaged/tweeted) and also when they are printed in books/magazines etc.(Less character implies less printing cost). In addition, it is easy and less error prone to type a short url when compared to its longer version.
